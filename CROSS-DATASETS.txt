-- Query 1 --
-- The expected results of this query would be the player ids of all players that participated in every game played in the NFL. Furthermore this query will yield the home and away team, the scores of the home and away team, and the year the game was played.
-- This query runs by using a select statement to grab the player_ID from the nfl_stats_modeled.Quarterback_Game_Logs_Beam_DF and grabs the information about the teams and the scores of the games from the nfl_weather_modeled.spreadspoke_scores table. The query accesses information from these tables by using the join operation in the from clause as well as utilizing filtration in the where clause to ensure the years from both tables are the same, ensuring the games are matched properly.

In order for this query to run properly the date field in the nfl_weather_modeled.spreadspoke_scores must be standardized into YYYY-MM-DD format.

select a.player_id, b.stadium, b.team_home, b.team_away, b.score_home, b.score_away, b.schedule_season
from nfl_stats_modeled.Quarterback_Game_Logs_Beam_DF a join nfl_weather_modeled.spreadspoke_scores b on a.game_date = b.schedule_date
where a.year = b.schedule_season

-- Query 2 --
-- This query's expected results would be to get the average passing completion percentage of each player when the wind was greater than 20 MPH. 
-- This query utilizes a select statement and a join statement to join data from the nfl_stats_modeled.Quarterback_Game_Logs_Beam_DF table and the nfl_weather_modeled.spreadspoke_scores table in order to filter player completion percentages when the wind was greater than 20 MPH. These percentages are then further filtered using an agregate function to find the rounded average of completion percentages. The query sorts the data using a group by clause according to player_id. 
-- In order for this query to run properly the date field in the nfl_weather_modeled.spreadspoke_scores must be standardized into YYYY-MM-DD format. --

select a.player_id, round(avg(a.completion_percentage), 2)
from nfl_stats_modeled.Quarterback_Game_Logs_Beam_DF a join nfl_weather_modeled.spreadspoke_scores b on a.game_date = b.schedule_date 
where a.year = b.schedule_season
and  b.weather_wind_mph > 20.0
group by a.player_id

--Query 3--
-- This query's expected results would be to get the average rushing yards of each player when the temperature was less than 20 degrees. 
-- This query utilizes a select statement and a join statement to join data from the nfl_stats_modeled.Quarterback_Game_Logs_Beam_DF table and the nfl_weather_modeled.spreadspoke_scores table  filter player rushing yards when the temperature was less than 20 degrees. These percentages are then further filtered using an agregate function to find the rounded average rushing yards in weather less than 20 degrees. The query sorts the data using a group by clause according to player_id. 
-- In order for this query to run properly the date field in the nfl_weather_modeled.spreadspoke_scores must be standardized into YYYY-MM-DD format. --

select a.player_id, round(avg(a.rushing_yards), 2)
from nfl_stats_modeled.Quarterback_Game_Logs_Beam_DF a join nfl_weather_modeled.spreadspoke_scores b on a.game_date = b.schedule_date 
where a.year = b.schedule_season
and  b.weather_temperature < 20.0
